# Automatic Number Plate Detection and Extraction using YOLOv5 and EasyOCR

This project demonstrates how to perform automatic number plate detection and extraction using YOLOv5 for object detection and EasyOCR for optical character recognition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect and extract number plates from images or videos. The system utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm to locate the number plates in an image or video frame. Once the number plates are detected, EasyOCR is used to extract the text from the number plates.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the images or videos containing number plates in the `input` directory.

2. Run the following command to perform number plate detection and extraction on images:

   ```bash
   python detect.py --input_type image --input_path input/image.jpg --output_path output/
   ```

   Replace `input/image.jpg` with the path to your input image and `output/` with the desired output directory.

3. Alternatively, to process videos, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python detect.py --input_type video --input_path input/video.mp4 --output_path output/
   ```

   Replace `input/video.mp4` with the path to your input video.

4. The detected number plates and their extracted text will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Results

The results of the number plate detection and text extraction will be stored in the `output` directory. The output files will have the same name as the input files with the detected number plates highlighted and the extracted text displayed.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the output generated by the system:

![Example 1](output/image1.jpg)
![Example 2](output/image2.jpg)
